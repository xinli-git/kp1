GOID: GO:0034361
Term: very-low-density lipoprotein particle
Ontology: CC
Definition: A triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle that is typically
    composed of APOB100, APOE and APOCs and has a density of about
    1.006 g/ml and a diameter of between 20-80 nm. It is found in blood
    and transports endogenous products (newly synthesized cholesterol
    and triglycerides) from the liver.
Synonym: very-low-density lipoprotein complex
Synonym: VLDL complex
Synonym: VLDL particle

GOID: GO:0034385
Term: triglyceride-rich plasma lipoprotein particle
Ontology: CC
Definition: A plasma lipoprotein particle that has a hydrophobic core
    enriched in triglycerides surrounded by an amphipathic monolayer of
    phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Triglyceride-rich
    lipoprotein particles transport lipids, which are non-covalently
    associated with the particles, in the blood.
Synonym: triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein particle
Synonym: triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle

GOID: GO:0003009
Term: skeletal muscle contraction
Ontology: BP
Definition: A process in which force is generated within skeletal
    muscle tissue, resulting in a change in muscle geometry. Force
    generation involves a chemo-mechanical energy conversion step that
    is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity, which
    generates force through ATP hydrolysis. In the skeletal muscle, the
    muscle contraction takes advantage of an ordered sarcomeric
    structure and in most cases it is under voluntary control.

GOID: GO:0034358
Term: plasma lipoprotein particle
Ontology: CC
Definition: A spherical particle with a hydrophobic core of
    triglycerides and/or cholesterol esters, surrounded by an
    amphipathic monolayer of phospholipids, cholesterol and
    apolipoproteins. Plasma lipoprotein particles transport lipids,
    which are non-covalently associated with the particles, in the
    blood or lymph.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:1990777
Term: lipoprotein particle
Ontology: CC
Definition: A spherical particle containing non-covalently associated
    proteins and lipids. Examples are plasma lipoprotein particles
    which transport lipids in the blood or lymph.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0032994
Term: protein-lipid complex
Ontology: CC
Definition: A macromolecular complex containing separate protein and
    lipid molecules.  Separate in this context means not covalently
    bound to each other.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0050879
Term: multicellular organismal movement
Ontology: BP
Definition: Any physiological process involved in changing the position
    of a multicellular organism or an anatomical part of a
    multicellular organism.
--------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0050881
Term: musculoskeletal movement
Ontology: BP
Definition: The movement of an organism or part of an organism using
    mechanoreceptors, the nervous system, striated muscle and/or the
    skeletal system.
