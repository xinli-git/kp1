<p><b>Total Purity Filtered Reads Sequenced</b> are filtered for vendor fail flags and exclude alternative alignment reads. <b>Alternative Aligments</b> are duplicate read entries providing alternative coordinates. <b>Failed Vendor QC Check</b> are reads which have been designated as failed by the sequencer. <b>Read Length</b> is the maximum length found for all reads. <b>Estimated Library Size</b> is the number of expected fragments based upon the total number of reads and duplication rate assuming a Poisson distribution.</p>

<p><b>Mapped</b> reads are those that were aligned. <b>Mapping Rate</b> is per total reads. <b>Mapped Unique</b> are both aligned as well as non-duplicate reads. <b>Mapped Unique Rate of Total</b> is per total reads. <b>Unique Rate of Mapped</b> are unique reads divided by all mapped reads. <b>Duplication Rate of Mapped</b> is the duplicate read divided by total mapped reads.  <b>Base Mismatch Rate</b> is the number of bases not matching the reference divided by the total number of aligned bases. <b>rRNA</b> reads are non-duplicate and duplicate reads aligning to rRNA regions as defined in the transcript model definition. <b>rRNA Rate</b> is per total reads. </p>

</table>

<p><b>Mapped Pairs</b> is the total number of pairs for which both ends map. <b>Unpaired Reads</b> are the number of reads that are lacking a mate. <b>End 1/2 Mapping Rate</b> is the number of mapped divided by the total number of End1/End2 reads. <b>End 1/2 Mismatch Rate</b> is the number of End 1 and 2 bases not matching the reference divided by the total number of mapped End 1 and 2 bases. <b>Fragment Length Mean/StdDev</b> is the mean distance, standard deviation between the start of an upstream read and the end of the downstream one. Only fragments contained within single exons are used. <b>Chimeric Pairs</b> are pairs whose mates map to different genes. </p>

<p>All of the above rates are per mapped read. <b>Intragenic Rate</b> refers to the fraction of reads  that map within genes (within introns or exons). <b>Exonic Rate</b> is the fraction mapping within exons. <b>Intronic Rate</b> is the fraction mapping within introns. <b>Intergenic Rate</b> is the fraction mapping in the genomic space between genes. <b>Split Reads</b> is the number of reads spanning an exon exon junction.  <b>Expression Profile Efficiency</b> is the ratio of exon reads to total reads. <b>Transcripts/Genes Detected </b> is the number of transcripts/Genes with at least 5 reads. </p>

<p><b>End 1/2 Sense</b> are the number of End 1 or 2 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction. Similarly, <b>End 1/2 Antisense</b> are the number of End 1 or 2 reads that were sequenced in the antisense direction.<b>End 1/2 Sense %</b> are percentages of intragenic End 1/2 reads that were sequenced in the sense direction. </p>
